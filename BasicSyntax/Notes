what is programming?
    it is an technicle process of giving an instructions to the computer that tells how to perform a task.

what is data structure?
    it's an named mamory location that can be used to store and organize data.

what is an Algorithm?
    it's a collection of steps to solve a perticular problem.

Note:
    DSA are the foundational block of a big building called programming.

why should we need programming languages?
    computer only understand binary language or 0/1 but human cann't able to write the binary code that way we use higherlevel programming languages that is cpp,java. but computer cann't understand higherlevel laguage also so that we use traslater to translate the highlevel language to binary code.

    there are 2 types of translaters:
    1. compiler:
        it compiles whole program at a time and compile it after that machine code will exicute.
    2. interpretur:
        it compile program line by line

    higherlevel languages are looks like english language



Types of programming paradigm:




Arrays:


shallow copy: 
->        capying the array reference
ex: int arr[] ={1,2,3,5,7}; //it creates an arr ref in stack with memory address(101) this memory is got in heap.
    int arr_2[] = arr; // it creates an arr_2 ref in stack with momery address of arr(101)

->   if we change the value in any array we can observe the changes in both array because they have same memory reference.




deep copy(cloning): 
 ->         copy array will get diff memory address but but copy the address from main array 
ex:  int arr[] ={1,2,3,5,7};  //it creates an arr ref in stack with memory address(101) this memory is got in heap memory
    int arr_2[] = arr.clone(); // it creates an arr_2 ref in stack with arr elements at diff memory address in heap

->    we can done deep copy by using Arrays.copy(arr,length)
ex:    int arr[] ={1,2,3,5,7};  //it creates an arr ref in stack with memory address(101) this memory is got in heap memory
       int arr_2[] = Arrays.copyOf(arr,5);  //this method need 2 parameters 1. array tells from which array we are coping the elements
                                                                            2. length 

->   if we change the value in any array we can observe the changes in that array only it willn't change both array values
